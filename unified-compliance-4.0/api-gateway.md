# API Gateway

The Unified Compliance 4.0 application is also an API Gateway, ie. a software platform where your organization can interact with the Unified Compliance library of data. API developers can make API calls to the gateway to retrieve data.

The gateway supports RESTful APIs that:

* Are HTTP-based
* Enable stateless client-server communication
* Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET
* Utilize an API Key for authentication

The onboarding flow of the Unified Compliance 4.0 application will guide you through the process of registering, which includes:

* Creation of your Organization
* Creation of your Administrator user and Account
* Enrollment in a Subscription plan
* Creation of a billing contact and payment method

Next, you can invite team members to your account.  Each team member will receive a unique API key used for authentication when making API requests.

A subscription plan will also provide you with API tokens. Tokens are deducted each time your team makes an API call (depending on the type of call made and the content downloaded).  Need more tokens? No problem - visit the Tokens page to add more tokens to your account!

Reach out to the Unified Compliance Support team should you be interested in this module of the application.
