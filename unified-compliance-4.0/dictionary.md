# Dictionary

The Dictionary module allows you to look up a term against several different dictionary providers, including, the Unified Compliance Dictionary.  We have integrated with the following third party Dictionary providers:  Merriam-Webster, Oxford, Wordnik, and Wiktionary. However, by default, we will search the Unified Compliance dictionary only (visit the Dictionary Settings page to modify the default behavior).

From the main navigation menu, select _Dictionaries_ and then select _Search_.  Enter a term and select _Search_ (or press the ENTER key) and the system will query all enabled dictionaries and display a consolidated list of results grouped by the part-of-speech for the term and then by dictionary provider.  There are 10 possible part-of-speech categories:  Noun, Verb, Pronoun, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection, Undefined, and Other.

Highlight one of the definitions and utilize the "A_dd to your dictionary_" link to add that term & definition pair to your glossary/dictionary.  Note: Only users with the Owner, Administrator or Editor role can add terms to a glossary/dictionary - see the Team page documentation for more details.

To perform a new search for another term, choose the _"X"_ to return to the main search page, or, enter a new term on the results page and press the search icon.

**Glossaries**

You can create Glossaries and add terms you search for to an applicable Glossary, or, manually add terms to a Glossary. &#x20;

To create, from the right hand navigation menu, select _Dictionary Settings._ Then choose the _Glossaries_ tab, enter a glossary name and choose _Create_.  You may also rename glossaries on this page.  Note: Only users with the Owner, Administrator or Editor role can create glossaries - see the Team page documentation for more details.

Next, from the left hand navigation menu, select _Dictionaries_ and then _Glossaries._  The list of glossaries created in Dictionary Settings will then appear for the workspace.  Here you can see how many terms have been added to a glossary, the creator/modifier and the last modified date.  Click on a column heading to sort the table by the column, either ascending or descending.

You can add Terms to to a glossary directly from the search results screen or you can manually add terms to a glossary.  1.  From the Search results screen, simply highlight a definition with mouseover and select the _Add to your dictionary_ link.  The term, part-of-speech, and definition will be pre-populated - simply select the Glossary to add to from the drop down list and then select _Add._  2. From the list of glossaries page, click on a glossary and you will now see the list of terms it contains.  Owners, Administrators & Editors can then select the _Add Term_ button.  Enter the term, select a part-of-speech, choose an Authority Source, enter a definition (the glossary to add to will be pre-populated) and select _Add_.

There is no limit to the number of terms/definitions that can be added to a Glossary.  The maximum number of Glossaries you create is 10.

**Terms**

Once you have selected a glossary you will see the list of terms that have been added to that glossary.  Each term will have a right hand side Action menu (only available to Owners, Administrators and Editors) where you can:

Edit - make modifications to the term (only available for terms that have been manually added)

Duplicate - make a copy of the term

Delete - remove the term from the glossary

Click on a term and you will see all of the details of that term including the definition and the attribution information.

Each term has a dropdown status column (only available to Owners, Administrators and Editors) where you can set the status to Draft, Submitted, Reviewed, Approved or Rejected.
