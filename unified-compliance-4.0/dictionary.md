# Glossaries

The Dictionary/Glossaries module allows you to look up a term against several different dictionary providers, including, the Unified Compliance Dictionary.  We have integrated with the following third party Dictionary providers:  Merriam-Webster, Oxford, Wordnik, and Wiktionary. However, by default, we will search the Unified Compliance Dictionary only (visit the Glossary Settings page from the right hand navigation menu to modify the default behavior).

From the main/left navigation menu, select _Glossaries_ and then select _Search_.  Enter a term and select _Search_ (or press the ENTER key) and the system will query all enabled dictionaries and display a consolidated list of results grouped by the part-of-speech for the term and then by dictionary provider.  There are 10 possible part-of-speech categories:  Noun, Verb, Pronoun, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection, Undefined, and Other.

Note that we will also search your glossaries for the term entered as well, and if found, your glossary name will be listed followed by the definitions of that term in the glossary.

Highlight one of the definitions and utilize the "A_dd to your glossary_" link to add that term & definition pair to your glossary.  Note: Only users with the Owner, Administrator or Editor role can add terms to a glossary - see the Team page documentation for more details about roles & permissions.

To perform a new search for another term, choose the _"X"_ to return to the main search page, or, enter a new term on the results page and press the search icon (or ENTER).

**Glossaries**

You can create glossaries and add terms you search for to an applicable Glossary, or, manually add terms to one or more glossaries. &#x20;

To create, from the right hand navigation menu, select _Glossary Settings._ Then choose the _Glossaries_ tab, enter a glossary name and choose _Create_.  You may also rename glossaries on this page.  Note: Only users with the Owner, Administrator or Editor role can create glossaries - see the Team page documentation for more details.

Next, from the left hand navigation menu, select _Glossaries_ and then _Search_ and search for a term.  You can add Terms to to a glossary directly from the search results screen or you can manually add terms to a glossary from the Terms page.  From the Search results screen, simply highlight a definition with mouseover and select the _Add to your glossary_ link.  The term, part-of-speech, and definition will be pre-populated - simply select the glossary/glossaries to add to from the list displayed (more than one can be selected).   There is no limit to the number of terms/definitions that can be added to a Glossary.  The maximum number of Glossaries you can create is 10.

**Terms**

From the main navigation menu under Glossaries, select _Terms_.  All of the terms that you have added to your glossary's will be displayed in alphabetical order.  _All_ will show all terms across all glossaries.  Choose a letter to only show terms that start with that letter.  Or, select one or more glossaries and only terms that have been added to those will appear. &#x20;

Click on a term to modify it.  Highlight a definition for the term and select the edit icon.  You will be able to edit the definition, part-of-speech, the source name/URL, and the glossary.  Make your changes and select _Save_.  You can also remove a definition from a term.  Click on a term, highlight the definition to remove, and select the trashcan to delete it (you will be asked to confirm).  Note:  When you delete the last definition of a term, that definition will be removed along with the term itself.&#x20;

To manually add a new term, from the Terms page, select _Add term_.  Enter the name of the term and the  definition.  Select a part-of-speech for the term.  Specify the Source name (default's to your workspace name) and URL (this should be in the form of "https://xyz.com" and it should the URL of the webpage on the source that contains the definition of the term).  Choose _Add another source_ to add more sources as needed.  Select one or more of your glossaries to add the term to.  And, choose _Add another definition_ to enter more than one definition as needed.  Once all values have been entered, then select _Add to my glossary_ to save the term.
