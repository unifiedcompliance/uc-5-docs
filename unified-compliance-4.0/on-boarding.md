# On-Boarding

**Step 1:  Register**

Open the following URL in your browser:  [https://app.unifiedcompliance.com](https://app.unifiedcompliance.com)

Choose the _Sign Up_ link, and enter your:

* **Email Address** - your email address.  **Note**:  Free email providers like "gmail.com" are not allowed.  This field is Required.

Press _Continue_.

* **Password** - minimum of 8 characters, 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 numeric and/or 1 special character.  This field is Required.

Press _Continue_. &#x20;

Verify your email address.  Click on the link in the email received.  Then return to the application and press "Click here after confirming your email". &#x20;

You will then be prompted to enter the following:

* **First Name**  - enter your first name.  This field is Required.
* **Last Name**  - enter your last name. This field is Required.

Press _Continue_.

**Note**: Since you are the first user to register in your account, you will automatically be the Owner of the account (known as "_Workspace_") and therefore have access to all of the administrative functions. After inviting team members, you can promote other users to have Administrator access, or even Owner access, along with other roles such as Billing, Editor and Reader. All of your _users_ will belong to your _workspace_, and, users are allowed to join other workspaces as well_._&#x20;

#### Step 2:  Choose Your Subscription

During registration you were automatically placed in a Free subscription plan, and, your workspace will be named with your first name followed by "Workspace" (for ex: Steve's Workspace).  To change the name of your workspace, from the right hand navigation menu, select _Workspace Settings_ and change the name on the _General_ tab. &#x20;

Next, select and pay for a Subscription.  From the right hand navigation menu, select _Plans and_ then select the _Upgrade_ button on the subscription plan that best suits your needs (note that subscriptions will be renewed automatically on an annual basis).    Next you will need to setup a payment method so follow the steps and fill out the forms accordingly.  You are now enrolled in the subscription selected.  From this same page you can (optionally) select Add-Ons to add to your subscription:

* Dictionary:  Create and share dictionaries and glossaries within your organization.
* Tokens:  Purchase more tokens to access content through the Unified Compliance API's.  Each initial download of an object is paid for using tokens.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the on-boarding process. As the Owner, you can now invite team members, review transaction history, add token funding to your workspace, and much, much more!&#x20;
