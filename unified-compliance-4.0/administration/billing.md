# Billing

On the Billing page, you can manage:

* Manage your billing contact
* Manage you payment method on file
* View & download Invoices
* View & download token transactions

#### Manage Billing Contact

In order to enter into a subscription, you set up a billing contact.  To make changes to that contact, simply select _Update invoice details_, make the appropriate changes, and select _Save_.

#### Manage Payment Method

In order to enter into a subscription, you set up a default payment method.  Your default payment method will be used for recurring charges, such as the annual renewal of your subscription. To make changes to that payment method, simply select _Update payment details_, make the appropriate changes, and select _Save_.  You can also change to another payment method (credit card and ACH are available).

#### View Invoices

Each of your invoices will be listed in the Invoices table.  You will see your subscription invoice(s), add-on invoice(s) (if added), and invoice(s) for additional tokens added to the subscription.  You may download any invoice by selecting the download icon and it will be saved to your local computer in PDF format.

**View Token Transactions**

Each of your token transactions will be listed in the Token Transactions table.  Each time you retrieve an object via the Unified Compliance REST-based APIs, your token balance will be deducted accordingly.  Line items with a type of "credit" are those transactions you have performed to add tokens to your subscription.  Line items with a type of "debit" are those transactions where you have retrieved an object via the REST-based APIs.  The token Amount column contains the amount of tokens added/deducted.
