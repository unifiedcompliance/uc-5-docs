# Plans

On the Plans page you can:

* Manage your Subscription - here you can switch to a different subscription if need be (note that you will stay in your current subscription until it expires)
* Manage your Add-On Modules - add and/or remove Add-On modules from your plan.  Currently, the Dictionary and PlantUML add-on modules are available for purchase.
* Manage your Token balance - each time you call a Unified Compliance REST-based API, your token balance will be deducted.  Note: The second time and subsequent downloads of the same object will not be deducted from your balance.  Add as many tokens as needed and your payment method on file will be charged accordingly.

To make other changes to your subscription, please contact Support.
