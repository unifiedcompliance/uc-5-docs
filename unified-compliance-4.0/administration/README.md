# Administration

Now that you have registered and completed the setup process, as the Administrator, you can perform several administrative duties on the account. For example, you can:

* Modify your Account details
* Invite more members to your team and manage those team members
* Review Billing Information and make modifications
* Review your Subscription and make modifications
* Review your current funding/token status and add funding to your account
* Utilize the token calculator to determine how many more tokens you may need for your account
* Review all of your billing and API transactions

These functions are accessible from the _Account_ option in the main navigation panel.  The following pages describe each of these in more detail.
