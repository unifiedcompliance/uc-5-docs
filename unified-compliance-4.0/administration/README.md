# Administration

Now that you have registered and completed the on-boarding process, as the Owner, you can perform several administrative duties on the workspace. For example, you can:

* Change workspaces from one to another.  Note:  Contact Support should you need to add additional workspaces.
* Team - Invite members to your team and manage those team members
* Workspace Settings - Make modifications to the configuration of your workspace
* Glossary Settings - only available if you have purchased the Dictionary Add-On.  Make modifications to your glossary settings here
* Plans - Review your Subscription and make modifications
* Billing - Review Billing Information and make modifications

These functions are accessible from the top right navigation menu (select the avatar with your initials / picture in it).  The following pages describe each of these in more detail.
