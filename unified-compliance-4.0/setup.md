**Note**: Since you are the first user to register in your account, you will automatically be the Owner of the account (known as "_Workspace_") and therefore have access to all of the administrative functions. After inviting team members, you can promote other users to have Administrator access, or even Owner access, along with other roles such as Billing, Editor and Reader. All of your _users_ will belong to your _workspace_, and, users are allowed to join other workspaces as well_._&#x20;

#### Step 2:  Email Address Verification

We'll send an email to your specified email address. Click on the link within the email to _verify_ your email address. Upon success, sign back in to the application using the email address and password specified in Step 1 where you will be taken to the main Dashboard page.

#### Step 3:  Choose Your Subscription

During registration you were automatically placed in a Free subscription plan, and, your workspace will be named with your first name followed by "Workspace" (for ex: Steve's Workspace).  To change the name of your workspace, from the right hand navigation menu, select _Workspace Settings_ and change the name on the _General_ tab. &#x20;

The next step is to select and pay for a Subscription.  From the right hand navigation menu, select _Plans and_ then select the _Upgrade_ button on the subscription plan that best suits your needs (and note that subscriptions will be renewed automatically on an annual basis).    Next you will need to setup a Billing contact so choose _Go to billing information_ and then select Update billing contact. Fill out the form accordingly and select _Save_.  You will now need to specify a payment method.  Select _Update payment method_ and then select Credit Card or ACH and select _Next Step_.  Fill out the form accordingly and select _Save_.&#x20;

Now select _View plans to upgrade,_ select _Upgrade_ on your subscription plan, and finally select _Confirm and Pay_.  You are now enrolled in the subscription selected.  From this same page you can select Add-Ons to add to your subscription:

* Dictionary:  Create and share dictionaries and glossaries for your organization.
* PlantUML:  Build, share, and consume PlantUML diagrams for your organization.
* Tokens:  Access to content through Unified Compliance API's is paid for using tokens.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the on-boarding process. As the Owner, you can now invite team members, review transaction history, add funding to your workspace, and much, much more!&#x20;
