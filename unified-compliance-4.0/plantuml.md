# PlantUML

The PlantUML module allows you to create, maintain and publish PlantUML diagrams.  All diagrams you create will be saved in your account and will be visible by all members of your team (and optionally you can publish them to the community). &#x20;

To create a PlantUML diagram, select _Create Diagram_ and then specify a Name, Type and Description (optional) and select _Continue_.  You will be taken to the diagram page where you can replace the default diagram with one of your own.  A preview of your diagram will be displayed, and once fully defined, select the _Save_ button.  From the edit diagram page you can also _Delete_ or _Export_ (PNG, SVG or TEXT format) your diagram.

To return to the list of diagrams page, select the PlantUML breadcrumb entry here:

From the listing page, you can search for diagrams using the main search bar and you can filter diagrams displayed by Visibility (Private or Community or All), Creator (who on your team created the diagram), and/or by Status.  You can also sort the results by any of the columns displayed, ie. Diagram Name, Diagram Type, Creator, Modifier, Modified Date, Status or Visibility.  Simply click on the column name to sort in ascending order or click it again to sort in descending order.

Single click on a row in the listing page to enter _Preview Mode_ for the diagram.  Double click on a row in the listing page to go directly to Edit Mode where you can modify the definition of the diagram.

On the far right of a row in the listing page is the _Action_ menu.  Here you can perform a number of actions on a diagram, for example:

* Publish - make the diagram visible to the Community
* Rename - modify the Name, Type or Description of the diagram
* Edit - change the definition of the diagram
* Duplicate - make a copy of the diagram
* Change Log - View all modifications made to a diagram (excluding Status) over time
* Approval History - View how the Status of a diagram has changed over time
* Delete - remove the diagram
