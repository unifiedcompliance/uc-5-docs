# PlantUML

The PlantUML module allows you to create, maintain and publish PlantUML diagrams.  All diagrams you create will be saved in your workspace and will be visible by all members of your team (and optionally you can publish them to the Community). &#x20;

From the main navigation menu, select _PlantUML_ then select _Library_.  To create a PlantUML diagram, select the _Create Diagram_ button.  A default diagram will appear where you can replace that with your own UML.  Then select _Save_ and then specify a Name, Type and Description (optional) and select _Continue_.  Your diagram is then saved - choose Cancel to exit this screen and return to the list of diagrams.  Or, select the _PlantUML_ breadcrumb at the top of the page.

From the listing page, you can search for diagrams using the main search bar and you can filter diagrams displayed by Visibility (Private or Community or All), Creator (who on your team created the diagram), and/or by Status.  You can also sort the results by any of the columns displayed.  Simply click on the column name to sort in ascending order or click it again to sort in descending order.

Single click on a row in the listing page to enter _Edit Mode_ for the diagram where you can modify the definition of the diagram.

On the far right of each row in the listing page is the _Action_ menu.  Here you can perform a number of actions on a diagram, namely:

* Publish - make the diagram visible to the Community (requires enablement under Workspace Settings)
* Rename - modify the Name, Type and/or Description of the diagram
* Edit - change the definition of the diagram
* Duplicate - make a copy of the diagram
* Export - download a PNG, SVG or Text version of the diagram
* Change Log - view all modifications made to the diagram (excluding Status) over time
* Approval History - view how the Status of the diagram has changed over time
* Delete - remove the diagram

Enjoy making PlantUML diagrams!
