# Use Cases

### I’m a data architect and

* I want to create (insert diagram type here) diagrams that my team can easily edit.
* I want to create a visualization of my JSON or YAML files.

### I’m a project manager and

* I want to create activity flows that I can share with my team so we can jointly edit them.
* I want to create Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) that my team can easily edit.

### I’m an Auditor and

* I want to be able to examine the organization’s data flow diagrams and comment on them, as necessary. Tracking versions as text is _much_ easier than tracking versions of images.
* I want to be able to examine the organization’s risk _models_, and examining the text that creates the diagram makes it easier to understand the diagrams.
