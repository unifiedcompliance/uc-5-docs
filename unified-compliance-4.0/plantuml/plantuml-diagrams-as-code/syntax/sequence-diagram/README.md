# Sequence Diagram

A UML sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows messages passing between different participants over time. Each participant is represented by a lifeline that spans the length of the diagram from top to bottom. Time also flows from top to bottom. The messages are represented by different types of arrows that move left and right between the participants lifelines.

Below is a basic example of three participants communicating with each other.&#x20;
