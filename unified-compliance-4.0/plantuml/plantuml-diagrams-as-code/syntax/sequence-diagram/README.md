# Sequence Diagram

A UML sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows messages passing between different participants over time. 
Sequence Diagrams allow you to describe the flow of interactions between different components or actors in your system or even manual processes. 

Sequence Diagrams can be a useful tool for understanding and communicating how different parts of a system interact with each other. They provide a visual representation of the order in which messages are sent between objects or components, making it easier to understand the sequence of events in a system.

Sequence diagrams also support features like declaring participants, allowing for more control over their representation and display order. Participants can be declared using keywords like “participant,” “actor,” “boundary,” “control,” and so on. Each participant is represented by a lifeline that spans the length of the diagram from top to bottom. Time also flows from top to bottom. The messages are represented by different arrows moving left and right between the participants’ lifelines.

Below is a basic example of three participants communicating with each other.
