# PlantUML

The PlantUML module allows you to create, maintain and share PlantUML diagrams.  All diagrams you create will be saved in your workspace and will be visible by all members of your team once you share them.

From the left hand navigation menu, select _PlantUML._ &#x20;

**All Tab**

This tab contains all diagrams that you have created plus all diagrams that have been shared with others in your workspace.

**My Diagrams Tab**

This tab contains all diagrams that you have created (shared and not shared with others in your workspace). &#x20;

**Shared Tab**

This tab contains all diagrams that have been shared in your workspace.

To create a PlantUML diagram, select the _Create Diagram_ button.  A default diagram will appear where you can replace that with your own UML.  Auto-Save will automatically save your diagram when you stop typing.  Use the back arrow link (<---) to return to the listing page.

From the listing page, you can search for diagrams using the main search bar and you can filter diagrams displayed by Type.  Simply click on a diagram to enter _Edit Mode_ where you can modify the UML text of the diagram.

In the top right of each diagram on the listing page is the _Action_ menu.  Here you can perform a number of actions on a diagram (only Owners, Administrators and Editors can make modifications), namely:

* Rename - modify the Name, Type and/or Description of the diagram
* Edit - change the UML text of the diagram
* Share / Unshare - share or unshare a diagram with your team members in the workspace.  Users must share their diagrams in order for other team members in teh workspace to view / modify them.
* Duplicate - make a copy of the diagram
* Export - download a PNG, SVG or Text version of the diagram
* Delete - remove the diagram
