# Dictionary Settings

**Dictionaries tab**

Every workspace automatically has a Dictionary created that contains the unique subset of terms / definitions that have been added to your glossaries.  By default the dictionary is named "My compliance dictionary" but you can rename it here.

You can also select the dictionaries that are enabled for your term search results.  By default, only Unified Compliance is enabled (cannot be disabled).  Select the other dictionary providers to enable them accordingly.

You can also configure if Hypernyms & Hyponyms should appear or not in term search results. Select each option accordingly. &#x20;

**Glossaries tab**

Here you can add a new glossary or rename an existing glossary.  When you add a new glossary, it will appear in the Dictionaries -> Glossaries page where you can then add terms to it. &#x20;
