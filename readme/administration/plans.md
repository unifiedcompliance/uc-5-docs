# Glossary Settings

**Your glossary Tab**

Every workspace automatically has a main Glossary created that contains the unique subset of terms / definitions that have been added to your glossaries.  By default the glossary is named "My compliance glossary" but you can rename it on this page.

You can also select the dictionaries that are enabled for your term search results.  By default, only Unified Compliance is enabled (cannot be disabled).  Select the other dictionary providers to enable them accordingly.

You can also configure if Hypernyms & Hyponyms should appear or not in term search results. Select each option accordingly. &#x20;

**Add glossaries Tab**

Here you can add a new glossary, rename an existing glossary, or delete an existing glossary.  When you add a new glossary, it will appear in the search results page (while searching for a term) where you can then add terms / definitions to it. &#x20;
