# Plans

On the Plans page you can:

* Manage your Subscription - here you can switch to a different subscription if need be (note that you will stay in your current subscription until it expires)
* Manage your Add-On Modules - add and/or remove Add-On modules from your plan.  Currently, only the Dictionary add-on module is available for purchase.
* Manage your Token balance - each time you call a Unified Compliance REST-based API, your token balance will be deducted.  Note: The second time and subsequent downloads of the same object will not be deducted from your balance.  Add as many tokens as needed and your payment method on file will be charged accordingly.

Upon sign-up, you will automatically have a free workspace created for you. On the Plans page, you can upgrade to the STIG Starter subscription plan. Simply choose the right plan for you and follow the steps to add your billing and payment information.

To make other changes to your subscription, please contact Support.
