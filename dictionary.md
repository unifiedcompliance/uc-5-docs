# Dictionary

The Dictionary module allows you to look up a term against several different dictionary providers, including, the Unified Compliance Dictionary.  We have integrated with the following third party Dictionary providers:  Merriam-Webster, Oxford, Cambridge, Wordnik, and Free.&#x20;

Enter a term and press _Submit_ and the system will query all 6 dictionaries and display a consolidated list of results grouped by the part-of-speech for the term.  There are 9 possible part-of-speech categories:  Noun, Verb, Pronoun, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection, and Other.

By default (unless a pre-filter on Dictionary provider was set), the system will return the results found for all Dictionary providers and applicable parts of speech:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

None of the checkboxes are checked meaning the results apply to all of them.  Filter the results by checking one or more of the checkboxes.  For example, selecting Nouns and Verbs as the parts of speech, and , Unified Compliance and Merriam-Webster as the dictionaries will result in:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

To see the results for a particular part-of-speech and dictionary, select the drop-down accordion of the part-of-speech first followed by the drop-down accordion of the dictionary:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

Here you will see the possible definitions for the selected part-of-speech.

To clear all selections / filters, choose the _Clear Filters_ option here:
