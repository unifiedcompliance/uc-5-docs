# API Gateway

The Unified Compliance API Gateway is a software platform where your organization can interact with the Unified Compliance Federated database. API developers can make API calls to the gateway to retrieve, post, and update data.

The API Gateway supports RESTful APIs that:

* Are HTTP-based
* Enable stateless client-server communication
* Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and PUT
* Utilize an API Key for authentication

The onboarding flow of the gateway will guide you through the process of registering, which includes:

* Creation of your admin, user, and master accounts
* Creation of your organization
* Enrollment in a subscription plan
* Creation of a payment method

Then, you can invite team members to your account.

A subscription plan will provide you with API tokens. Tokens are deducted each time your team makes an API call. Need more tokens? No problem - visit the Funding page to add more tokens to your account manually.
