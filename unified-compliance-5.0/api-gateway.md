# API Gateway

The Unified Compliance 5.0 application is also an API Gateway, ie. a software platform where your organization can interact with the Unified Compliance Federated database. API developers can make API calls to the gateway to retrieve, post, and update data.

The gateway supports RESTful APIs that:

* Are HTTP-based
* Enable stateless client-server communication
* Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE
* Utilize an API Key for authentication

The onboarding flow of the Unified Compliance 5.0 application will guide you through the process of registering, which includes:

* Creation of your Organization
* Creation of your administrator user and master account(s)
* Enrollment in a subscription plan
* Creation of a billing contact and payment method

Next, you can invite team members to your account.

A subscription plan will provide you with API tokens. Tokens are deducted each time your team makes an API call. Need more tokens? No problem - visit the Tokens page to add more tokens to your account.
