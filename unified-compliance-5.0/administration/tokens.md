# Tokens

Use the Tokens page to add additional tokens to your account. This adds tokens on top of your current subscription. Funding is not a recurring process (only when your subscription renews) as it needs to be done manually on an as-needed basis.

#### Add Tokens

Simply use the slider to select (in increments of 50) the number of tokens to add to your account, then press the _Add Tokens_ button. The amount to be charged and the payment method on file will be displayed.

You will be sent an invoice and/or receipt electronically via email for this transaction. Please retain a copy for your records. You will also find a record of this transaction under _Billing => History_.

By clicking the Add Tokens button, you authorize Unified Compliance to electronically debit and, if necessary, credit your account to correct erroneous debits. If you have any questions, or if you wish to revoke your authorization, please contact Unified Compliance. We are happy to assist you.
