# Team

**Step 1:  Choose **_**Team**_

Beneath Administration on the left side of the application, choose _Team_.

**Step 2:  Choose **_**Invite User**_

Press the _Invite User_ button on the Team page.

**Step 3:  Specify User Details**

In the modal window presented, enter the following:

* First Name (the first name of the user)
* Last Name (the last name of the user)
* Email Address (the email address of the user)

Now choose _Invite User_. An email will be generated and sent to the email address specified. Upon receipt, the user can accept the invitation via the link within the email. (see Step 4 below).

**Step 4:  User Accepts Invitation**

After selecting the link (in the email) to accept the invitation, the user will be navigated to the registration form. They will see a message that the Administrator of their organization invited them, and they can specify the following:

* First Name (the first name of the user)
* Last Name (the last name of the user)
* Email Address (the email address of the user)
* Password (the password of the user)

The user will then select _Register and Accept Invite_.

**Step 5:  Email Address Verification**

An email will be generated and sent to the email address specified in Step 4, whereby the user can verify their email address. Once the user selects the link within the email, they will be navigated back to the application where they can then log in.

**Step 6:  Sign In**

The user will be prompted for their sign-in credentials, which are email address and password.

**Step 7:  Accept the Terms of Use**

The user will be presented with the Terms of Use. By scrolling to the bottom and pressing _I Accept_, they accept the terms of use and can access the application. Users (non-Administrators) are only allowed to update their profile information and will not have access to all of the other Administrator functions.

* Copy API Key - use this to copy the API Key that is unique per user
* Refresh - use this to generate a new API Key for the user
* Promote - use this to modify the user type from _User_ to _Admin (only available for Active users)_
