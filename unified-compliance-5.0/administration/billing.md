# Billing

On the Billing page, you can manage:

* Your current API token balance
* Your most recent invoices
* Your Billing Contact information
* Your current Payment Method that is used for recurring payments

#### Add API Tokens

To add API tokens to your account, select _Add Funds_ from the token balance card (or select _Tokens_ in the left navigation bar).

#### Invoice History

To see Invoice history, select _History_ from the Recent Invoices card (or select the _History_ tab).

#### Billing Contact

Under the Information tab, you can modify Billing Contact information, including the Name, Email, Address, and Phone Number. When your changes are done, press the _Save_ button.

#### Payment Method

Under the Information tab, you can also modify your Payment Method on file used for recurring payments. Select _Manage_ in the payment method card. If, for example, you have a credit card on file that has expired, you will be able to update the expiration date here. Make the appropriate changes and press the Save button.

#### Need to change your payment method from one type to another?

Select _Manage_ in the payment method card and then select _Change_. Select the new payment method (Credit Card, ACH, or Purchase Order) and then select the _Next Step_ button. Fill in all fields for the new payment method and select the _Save_ button. Note that you can only have a single payment method on file at a time. And, if you change to the ACH Bank Account method, this will require account verification. Two micro-deposits will be made to the account. Once those are received, return to this page and enter the amounts of the deposits to verify the payment method change.
