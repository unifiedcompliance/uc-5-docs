# Setup

#### Step 1: Register

Open the following URL in your browser:  [https://](https://agpmdev.complianceascode.net/)app.unifiedcompliance.com

Choose the _Register_ link, and enter your:

* Email Address
* Password & Confirm Password
* First Name
* Last Name

Then press the _Register_ button.

Note: The first user to register for your account will be the Administrator and therefore have access to all the administrative functions. After inviting team members, you can promote other users to have Administrator access. All of your _users_ will belong to your _account_, however, users are allowed to join other accounts as well_._&#x20;

#### Step 2: Account Verification

We'll send an email to your specified email address. Click on the link within the email to _verify_ your email address. You will be taken to the application where you can click on the _Verify_ button to confirm your email address.  Upon success, sign back in to the application using the email address and password specified in Step 1. &#x20;

#### Step 3: Agree to the Terms of Use

Read the Terms of Use (and be sure to scroll all the way down to the end) and if you agree, select _I Accept_.

#### Step 4: Set Up your Organization

The application will attempt to locate and pre-populate your Organization details based on the domain of the email address specified in Step 1. If your Organization was found then the Name and Domain will be pre-populated.  You must still specify at least two social addresses for the Organization to proceed while the other fields are optional.  Otherwise, enter the following:

* Organization Name (the name of your Organization/Company) - Required
* Founded (the year the Organization was founded) - Required
* Description (a description of your Organization) - Required
* Other Names (for example, a sub-company or division name) - Optional
* Primary Domain (the primary web domain of your Organization, for example, _unifiedcompliance.com_) - Required
* Social Addresses (enter at least two social addresses for your Organization, for example, [_https://www.facebook.com/UnifiedCompliance/_](https://www.facebook.com/UnifiedCompliance/) and [_https://twitter.com/the\_ucf_](https://twitter.com/the\_ucf)). The following social platforms are available for selection: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Github, Medium, Vimeo, Pinterest, Reddit, and Dribble. - Required
* Primary Address (enter the primary address of your Organization) - Optional
* Primary Phone (enter the primary phone number of your Organization) - Optional
* Primary Email (enter the primary email address of your Organization) - Optional

For some of the fields above, you can enter multiple values, so utilize the _Primary_ option to make one in each list the _primary_ value.&#x20;

When finished, select the _Save Organization_ button to save and proceed to the next step.

#### Step 5: Setup User Account Details

As mentioned above, users in the system only have a name and email on file. Users belong to an account, so now we need to provide the details of the account your users belong to. Do so by specifying the following.

* Account Name (a name for the Account that all users belong to)
* Account Address (the primary address of the Account)
* Account Phone Number (the primary phone number of the Account)

When finished, select the _Save & Continue_ button to proceed to the next step.

#### Step 6: Choose Your Subscription

Select the subscription plan that best suits your needs. Subscriptions will be renewed automatically based on the timeframe you select:

* Monthly (your subscription will automatically be renewed on the same day of each month)
* Yearly \_\_ (your subscription will automatically be renewed annually)

Now select a subscription plan. When finished, select the _Save & Continue_ button to proceed to the next step.

#### Step 6: Specify a Billing Contact and Payment Method

First, specify billing contact details. This contact information can be different from any of your users (for example, if you have a person/group within your Organization that is responsible for billing). Specify the following:

* Billing Contact Name (the name of the person responsible for billing)
* Billing Contact Email (the email address of the billing contact)
* Billing Address (the street, city, state, and zip code of the billing contact)
* Billing Contact Phone Number (the phone number of the billing contact)

If there are any problems with your account or subscription plan (if the credit card on file has expired and failed to renew), we'll send an email to the billing contact to let them know.

Second, choose from one of the following payment types: Credit Card, ACH Direct Debit, or Purchase Order.

For **Credit Card** payment, specify the following:

* Card Number (the number on the front of the credit card)
* Card Expiry Date (the expiration date in MM/YY format)
* Card Security Code (the 3 or 4-digit code on the back of the credit card)
* Cardholder Name (the name on the front of the credit card)
* Cardholder Email (the email address of the cardholder)

For **ACH Direct Debit** Payment, specify the following:

* Bank Name (the financial institution)
* Account Type (either _Checking_ or _Savings_)
* Routing Number (the routing number associated with the bank account - 9 digits in length)
* Account Number (the account number associated with the bank account)

Note: A bank account payment method will need verification before it can be used for funding. You will receive two small deposits into your bank account for verification purposes, which will appear in your account within 1-2 business days. Your statement will have a description that includes AMTS followed by the two micro-deposit amounts. Once you have received the deposits, please return to this page in the gateway application and enter the amounts in order to verify your bank account. In following this verification process, you authorize Unified Compliance to electronically credit and, if necessary, debit your account to correct erroneous credits.

For **Purchase Orders**, specify the following:

* Purchase Order Number
* Purchase Order Terms (number of days)

Our finance team will review new purchase order requests and contact you once approved.

Once you have finished specifying your billing contact and payment method details, press _Agree & Subscribe_ to continue to the next step.

#### Step 7: All Done

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the setup of your Administrator user, Organization, Account, Subscription, Billing Contact, and Payment Method. As the Administrator, you can now invite team members, review dashboard reports, review transaction history, add funding to your account, and more! Your API key (for the Administrator user) will appear on this page - keep your API key in a safe place and use it when making all API calls under the Administrator user.
