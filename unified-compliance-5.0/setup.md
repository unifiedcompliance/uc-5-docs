After inviting team members, you can promote other users to have Administrator access, if need be. All of your _users_ will belong to your _account_, and, users are allowed to join other accounts as well_._&#x20;

#### Step 2:  Account Verification

We'll send an email to your specified email address. Click on the link within the email to _verify_ your email address. You will be taken to the application where you can click on the _Verify_ button to confirm your email address.  Upon success, sign back in to the application using the email address and password specified in Step 1. &#x20;

#### Step 3:  Agree to the Terms of Use

Read the Terms of Use (and be sure to scroll all the way down to the end).  If you agree, select _I Accept_.

#### Step 4:  Set Up your Organization

The application will attempt to locate and pre-populate your Organization details based on the domain of the email address specified in Step 1.  If your Organization was found, then the Name and Domain will be pre-populated.  You must still specify at least two social addresses for the Organization to proceed while the other fields are optional.  Otherwise, enter the following:

* **Name** (the name of your Organization/Company).  This field is Required.
* **Founded** (the year the Organization was founded).  This field is Required.
* **Description** (a description of your Organization).  This field is Required.

* **Social Addresses** (enter at least two social addresses for your Organization, for example, [_https://www.facebook.com/UnifiedCompliance/_](https://www.facebook.com/UnifiedCompliance/) and [_https://twitter.com/the\_ucf_](https://twitter.com/the\_ucf)). The following social platforms are available for selection: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Github, Medium, Vimeo, Pinterest, Reddit, and Dribble.  This field is Required.

For some of the fields above, you can enter multiple values, so utilize the _Primary_ option to make one in each list the _primary_ value.&#x20;

When finished, select the _Save Organization_ button to save and proceed to the next step.

#### Step 5:  Account Details

Users in the system only have a name and email on file.  Users belong to an account, so now you need to provide the details of the account your users will belong to (including the Administrator). Specify the following:

* **Account Name** (the name for the Account that all users belong to - may or may not be the same as the Organization name).  This field is Required.
* **Account Address** (the primary address of the Account - may or may not be the same as the Organization address).   This field is Required.

Select the subscription plan that best suits your needs. Subscriptions will be renewed automatically based on the timeframe you select:

* Monthly (your subscription will automatically be renewed on the same day of each month)
* Yearly (your subscription will automatically be renewed annually)

When finished, select the _Save & Continue_ button to proceed to the next step.

#### Step 7:  Specify a Billing Contact and Payment Method

First, specify billing contact details. This contact information can be different from any of your users (for example, if you have a person/group within your Organization that is responsible for billing). Specify the following:

* **Name** (the name of the person responsible for billing).  This field is Required.
* **Email Address** (the email address of the billing contact).  This field is Required.
* **Address** (the street, city, state, and zip code of the billing contact).  This field is Required.
* **Phone Number** (the phone number of the billing contact).  This field is Required.

**Note:**  Utilize the _Show Existing_ option to pre-populate an address and/or phone number specified prior when defining the Organization and Account.

If there are any problems with your account or subscription plan (for example, if the credit card on file has expired and failed to renew), we'll send an email to the billing contact to let them know.

Second, choose from one of the following payment types: Credit Card, ACH Direct Debit, or Purchase Order.

For **Credit Card** payment, specify the following:

* **Card Number** (the number on the front of the credit card).  This field is Required.
* **Card Expiry Date** (the expiration date in MM/YY format).  This field is Required.
* **Card Security Code** (the 3 or 4-digit code on the back of the credit card).  This field is Required.
* **Cardholder Name** (the name on the front of the credit card).  This field is Required.
* **Cardholder Email** (the email address of the cardholder).  This field is Required.

For **ACH Direct Debit** Payment, specify the following:

* **Bank Name** (the financial institution).  This field is Required.
* **Account Type** (either _Checking_ or _Savings_).  This field is Required.
* **Routing Number** (the routing number associated with the bank account - 9 digits in length).  This field is Required.
* **Account Number** (the account number associated with the bank account).  This field is Required.

Note: A bank account payment method will need verification before it can be used for funding. You will receive two small deposits into your bank account for verification purposes, which will appear in your account within 1-2 business days. Your statement will have a description that includes "AMTS" followed by the two micro-deposit amounts. Once you have received the deposits, please return to this page in the application and enter the amounts to verify your bank account. In following this verification process, you authorize Unified Compliance to electronically credit and, if necessary, debit your account to correct erroneous credits.

For **Purchase Orders**, specify the following:

* **Purchase Order Number** (the PO number).  This field is Required.
* **Purchase Order Terms** (number of days).  This field is Required.

Our finance team will review new purchase order requests and contact you once approved.

Once you have finished specifying your billing contact and payment method details, press _Agree & Subscribe_ to complete the on-boarding process!

#### Step 8: All Done

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the setup of your Administrator, Organization, Account, Subscription, Billing Contact, and Payment Method. As the Administrator, you can now invite team members, review transaction history, add funding to your account, and much, much more!&#x20;
